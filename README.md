# CtrlShiftC
A Firefox extension that remaps Ctrl+Shift+C to copy selection

# Why?
Most terminal emulators use Ctrl+Shift+C to copy text. I've gotten used to this and I find myself using it in web browsers all the time. It's really frustrating when Dev Tools opens when I meant to copy something! This extension solves my problem by remapping Ctrl+Shift+C to copy. Dev Tools is still accessible through F12.

# Can I change the shortcut to something else?
No.
